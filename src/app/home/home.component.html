      <p class="text-md m-t-10 m-b-20">
        Angular is the open source TypeScript framework used for the web and mobile application development. The
        popularity of this cross-platform framework keeps growing with the number of unparalleled solutions built with
        Angular upsurges as well. It’s not an ideal solution for just one kind of software but includes the capabilities
        to accomplish various web development activities and improves the app or the website with the required
        functionalities.
        <br>
        To create a dynamic website, you have to hire angular developers to work on this robust framework. The Angular
        developers have the capabilities to create Single Page Applications (SPA) with multiple functionalities with
        intuitive designs. Currently, we have highly skilled angular developers who can improve the work proficiency of
        browser-based application and offer high-end results. As such, most enterprises prefer to hire skilled angular
        developers to build custom innovative solutions. When looking for angular developers, it is vital to understand
        their roles and responsibilities before proceeding further.

      <h2 class="m-t-17 doc-subtitle">What is Angular?</h2>
      <p class="text-md m-t-10 m-b-20">
        Angular is a comprehensive term used to denote all the versions that came after AngularJS or Angular 1. It is
        the latest and refined front-end development platform till date to develop a responsive and dynamic web
        application. The history of Angular traces back to the year 2009 when Google engineers Adam Abrons and
        MiskoHebery developed the framework Angular 1 and released officially in 2010. The Angular team has launched
        several versions of Angular since 2010. The first version of Angular is known as AngularJS, which is responsible
        for creating dynamic single page applications. Then, Google rewrote the AngularJS framework entirely and
        released the Angular 2 in 2016. The Angular 2 and all the subsequent versions are called in the common term,
        Angular.

      <h2 class="m-t-17 doc-subtitle">AngularJS Vs Angular: Which to Choose?</h2>
      <p class="text-md m-t-10 m-b-20">
        The key difference between AngularJS and Angular was the shift from MVC architecture to a component-based style
        that enables the Angular development faster. Furthermore, the components developed with Angular can be saved in
        the form of the web element and used as a component in any form of HTML page even outside the framework.
        <br>

        If you are building a new web application with any one of these platforms, it is ideal to start with Angular,
        which is better suited towards the Server-Side Rendering (SSR) friendly, and component-based JavaScript
        frameworks. When newer versions of Angular were released, the AngularJS framework still continues as a viable
        option for existing AngularJS websites. It is a logical option for the construction of advanced web apps builds
        on the JavaScript framework, particularly for Blockchain based solutions. Similarly, AngularJS can be used to
        build single page apps that offer a satisfying user experience.
        <br>
        While comparing AngularJS vs Angular in terms of performance, Angular is five times faster than its previous
        version. In addition, AngularJS doesn’t support mobile devices, but Angular supports all mobile devices. Angular
        comes with more language choices, including TypeScript, JavaScript, PureScript, Dart, etc. However, AngularJS
        supports only JavaScript.
